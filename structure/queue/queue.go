/*
A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The main operations are enqueue (to add an item) and dequeue (to remove an item).

Initialize the Queue:

Class Queue
    Define queue as an empty list

    Function enqueue(value):
        Append value to queue

    Function dequeue():
        if queue is not empty:
            Remove and return the first item from queue
        else:
            Return "Queue is empty"

    Function peek():
        if queue is not empty:
            Return the first item from queue
        else:
            Return "Queue is empty"
