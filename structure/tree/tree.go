package structure

/*
Define Tree Node Structure:

Create a class or structure named TreeNode:
Include a value attribute to store the data.
Include a children attribute, which is a list that holds references to TreeNode instances (the node's children).
Initialize the Tree:

Create the root node:
Initialize the root node as an instance of TreeNode, setting its value and optionally, initializing its children as an empty list.
Function to Add Child to a Node:

Given a node and a value, create a new child node:
Create a new instance of TreeNode with the given value.
Append this new node to the children list of the given node.
Function to Traverse the Tree (e.g., Depth-First Search):

Start at the root or any given node.
For each child of the current node:
Visit the child node (you can print the node's value).
Recursively call the traversal function for each child.
