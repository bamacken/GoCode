/*
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The main operations are push (to add an item) and pop (to remove an item).

Class Stack
    Define stack as an empty list

    Function push(value):
        Append value to stack

    Function pop():
        if stack is not empty:
            Remove and return the last item from stack
        else:
            Return "Stack is empty"

    Function peek():
        if stack is not empty:
            Return the last item from stack
        else:
            Return "Stack is empty"
